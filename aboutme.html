          <p>I am currently a front end engineer II within the TJX digital web store team. I am passionate about both a user's visual and functional experience.<br><br>
            With that, I still find myself eager to build on my academic foundation as well as stay in tune with the latest technologies and best practices.<br><br>
            To each project, I bring a unique, adaptive perspective, along with a critical and diagnostic mindset. My strengths include attention to detail as well as collaboration among both developers and non-developers.<br><br>
            When I am not coding, you can find myself either playing tennis, soccer or watching Ted Lasso. I also enjoy photography as well as world traveling.</p>

        <p>
          In the fall of 2017, I walked into my first class of general chemistry taught by Professor Wolfman of Boston College with the vision of becoming a doctor. 6 months later, I strayed the pre med track and wrote my first line of code. Nonetheless, I continued to focus my studies on biology and psychology. 8 months later, Professor Wolfman gave me the advice that would change my path. He told me <strong>the passion I had for premed was not the passion he knew I was capable of</strong>. A year later, I had found the passion he was talking about.<br><br>
          My major was changed, my minor was added and I was officially a student within the computer science department. General computer science courses continued over the next year and a half. In November of 2019, I took it upon myself to learn HTML and CSS. My goal was to learn just enough to create a page where I could display my photography. <br><br>
          The learning continued and in February of 2020, I committed to taking a semester off of school to explore the professional world of web development. I had committed to a 6 month internship 979 miles away from my home town at a multi-channel retail company, Colony Brands based in Monroe, Wisconsin.<br><br>
          My struggles I faced nearly turned me away until the results started to yield themselves. Upon coming back to my college campus, I had more passion, more drive, and more confidence in my abilities than any time before.<br><br>
          Summer of 2021, I worked diligently within the corporate world of TJX Companies. I had temporarily steered away from development and became a digital web operations intern. This internship provided me with expertise in professional development, corporate politics, digital issues and their triages, best practices, and many more crucial areas of TJX Digital.<br><br>
          Shortly after completing my internship with TJX, I accepted a full time position as a software engineer at TJX Companies. At that point, I made it clear my passions lied in the development side of software engineering. As of January 2022, I was officially an alumni of Boston College and better yet, a software engineer I at TJX Companies. I developed my professional skills in my first few months having participated in the early-in-career program with other engineers throughout TJX IT. After completion of the program, I began day to day efforts within the TJX IT Digital Web Store Team.
